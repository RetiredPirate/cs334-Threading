This is the README file for SudokuChecker, written by Andrew Williams

The executable does not take user input. The main method creates two sudoku
puzzles, and spawns three threads for each to check the rows, columns, and
boxes of the puzzle. It then prints the puzzle, a message for each tread spawn,
and the result of the check.

Jake was my partner, but we did most of the project separately, as I was out
of town the weekend before this was due. I worked for about 8 hours on my
portion, most of it learning how to use pthread in C++.

Compilation Instructions:

This program is only one file, so a simple g++ command will compile
it just fine, and no makefile was needed.
